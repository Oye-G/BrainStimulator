The AAL2 atlas is distributed by the university of Bordeaux and is available under http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL-216 as well as in SPM12.
The atlas is part of an in-house package developed by the Neurofunctional Imaging Group (GIN, UMR5296, Bordeaux, France), which is available to the scientific 
community as copyright freeware under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Its original intent is anatomical labeling of data acquired through functional 
brain mapping experiments. In BrainStimulator, we use it (in an upsampled version, 1x1x1 mm) as another anatomical atlas of Colin27 to target brain regions 
in the context of simulating brain stimulation. 

The atlas is described in the following publication:

automated anatomical labeling atlas. NeuroImage 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.075.
