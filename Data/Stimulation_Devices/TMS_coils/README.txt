The first two TMS coils were used from the opensource software package SimNIBS
(http://www.simnibs.de):
1) "Magstim_figure8_coil/" from SimNIBS 
2) "Medtronic_MCB70/" from SimNIBS  
3) "Double_Cone_Coil/" - a double cone coil approximation (95 degree opening angle between
coil wings, wing coil outer radius: 70 mm)  
NOTE: This coil is based on Magstim_figure8_coil while coil parameters (sizes, opening angle) were taken from to:
Calculating the Electric Fields in the Human Brain
by Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, 
Procedings of 2013 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory,
Mai Lu, Shoogo Ueno


NOTE: If those TMS coils are used and published SimNIBS requires to cite:
