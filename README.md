BrainStimulator
===============

BrainStimulator is a software package to simulate (transcranial) brain stimulation and is implemented in SCIRun's (version 5) scientific problem solving environment. 

The Data folder contains anatomical models and stimulation devices (TMS coils, tDCS electrode prototypes).

The Documentation folder contains tutorials on how to use BrainStimulator in SCIRun 5.

The Networks folder contains sample networks used in the tutorials. Set **SCIRun Data** in the SCIRun 5 GUI (under **Configurations**, **Options** tab) to the BrainStimulator directory to automatically set up paths to SCIRun data in the sample networks.
